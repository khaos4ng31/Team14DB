This folder contains what I have put together so far, it includes a login page that calls a login.php script to validate the username and pass. The home page is a copy of today.php

Each folder is a "directory" in my local apache webserver.

Load the login and home folders into your local apache installations htdocs folder and navigate to localhost/login in your browser.
